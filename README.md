To run simply just type in git clone after copying this git URL, then run chasm-linux/inital.sh; this should download the chasm soundtrack and create a folder named `./chasm`; This will also create a shortcut named `Chasm` and an addon shortchut named `Chasm-Addon` user `/usr/bin/`.

### Install Requirements
* GIT
* DOS-BOX

**Before running the script** to install Chasm, you need to download the portable zip file off of here https://www.moddb.com/games/chasm-the-rift/downloads/chasm-portable and place it inside the same directory where these scripts reside. When everything is downloaded you should be able to run the script `inital.sh` successfully with the command `sh inital.sh`; I've also included a removal script to remove the shortcut to chasm and the folder as a complete uninstall; you'll need to run sudo. Be sure to place the zip file inside the cloned directory of chasm-linux and you should be all set, be sure to install dosbox before running Chasm.
