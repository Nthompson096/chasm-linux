To run simply just type in git clone after copying this repo URL, then run chasm-linux/inital.sh; this should unzip and extract the the chasm soundtrack and create a folder named `$HOME/.chasm/`; This will also create a shortcut named `Chasm` and an addon shortchut named `Chasm-Addon` inside the `/usr/bin/` dir, will also create an editor shortcut for you named `Chasm-Edit`; this will be worked on however.

### Install Requirements

* GIT
* DOS-BOX

You should be able to run `inital.sh` successfully with the command `sh inital.sh`; I've also included a removal script to remove the shortcut to 
chasm and the folder as a complete uninstall; you'll need to run sudo. Be sure to place the zip file inside 
the cloned directory of chasm-linux and you should be all set, be sure to install dosbox before running 
Chasm.
