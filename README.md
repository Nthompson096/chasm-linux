To run simply just type in git clone after copying this git URL, then run chasm-linux/inital.sh; this should download everything inside a folder named `./chasm`
This will also create a shortcut named `Chasm` and an addon shortchut named `Chasm-Addon`.
### Install Requirements
* GIT

**Before running the script** to install Chasm, you can just download the portable zip file off of here https://www.moddb.com/games/chasm-the-rift/downloads/chasm-portable when everything is downloaded you should be able to run the script `inital.sh` successfully; I've also included a remove script to remove the shortcut to chasm and the folder as a complete uninstall. Be sure to place the zip file inside the cloned directory of chasm-linux and you should be all set.
