To run simply just type in git clone after copying this git URL, then run chasm-linux/inital.sh; this should download everything inside a folder named `./chasm`
This will also create a shortcut named `Chasm`.
### Install Requirements

* PIP
* GIT
* gdown (pip)

To install gdown simply run `pip install gdown` as a regular user and export the path of gdown as a regular user simply run `export PATH=/home/username/.local/bin:$PATH` to export can also do this inside the bash rc file with a text editor, be sure to replace username with the actual user; when everything is downloaded you should be able to run the script `inital.sh` successfully; I've also included a remove script to remove the shortcut to chasm and the folder as a complete uninstall.
